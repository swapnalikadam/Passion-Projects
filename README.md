# Landing Page for Product Promotion

In digital marketing, a Landing Page is an independent web page designed exclusively for a marketing or advertising initiative. This dedicated page serves as the destination where a visitor arrives or "lands" after clicking on a link within an email or advertisements on platforms such as Google, Bing, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, or other similar locations on the internet. Unlike regular web pages that often have multiple objectives and encourage exploration, landing pages are specifically crafted with a singular focus or goal, commonly referred to as a call to action (CTA).

I have designed this landing page using HTML5 and CSS3 for the promotion of our **Web Design Software Trial**. It features a responsive layout compatible with devices such as iPhone 12 Pro, iPad Pro, and desktops.
