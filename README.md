# InstaPing Application

I have implemented the notification feature for the InstaPing application, utilizing React.js for the frontend functionalities and CSS for the user interface styling. The 'Client' is designed to manage browser-related code, while the 'Socket' is dedicated to handling connections through the Socket.IO library, facilitating communication with the Node.js server. In the application, users can click on a heart-shaped icon to 'like' a post, resulting in the icon turning red, and a notification is sent to the user, informing them that their post has been liked by another InstaPing user.
