In digital marketing, a Landing Page is an independent web page designed exclusively for a marketing or advertising initiative. This dedicated page serves as the destination where a visitor arrives or "lands" after clicking on a link within an email or advertisements on platforms such as Google, Bing, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, or other similar locations on the internet. Unlike regular web pages that often have multiple objectives and encourage exploration, landing pages are specifically crafted with a singular focus or goal, commonly referred to as a call to action (CTA).

I have designed this Landing Page for **Web Design Software Trial Promotion** as a responsive layout compatible with devices like iPhone 12 Pro and iPad Pro with Desktop layout.
