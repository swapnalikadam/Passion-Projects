# Passion-Projects
This repository features a variety of personal web development projects, ranging from responsive websites using fundamental HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript to developing a React Redux shopping cart for the checkout process on an e-commerce product-selling website. Each project includes a README file providing context, purpose, and the technologies used.
