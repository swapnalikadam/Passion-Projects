# InstaPing Application

I have developed a notification feature for the InstaPing application to gain insight into the development process of popular chatting apps like Instagram or Facebook, which are widely used and in high demand globally.

I have implemented the notification feature for the InstaPing application, utilizing React.js for the frontend functionalities and CSS for the user interface styling. The 'Client' is designed to manage browser-related code, while the 'Socket' handles connections through the Socket.IO library, facilitating communication with the Node.js server. In the application, users can click on a heart-shaped icon to 'like' a post, resulting in the icon turning red, and a notification is sent to the user, informing them that their post has been liked by another InstaPing user.

# To Run The Code

Split the terminal window into two parts and run both the client and server side simultaneously.

open the client folder path - run npm start in the terminal

open the socket folder path - run npm start in the terminal
