# React Redux E-commerce Shopping Cart
React Redux is employed to develop an e-commerce shopping cart website, structuring the code with distinct folders for actions, components, and reducers to enhance code organization and maintainability. By logically segregating different aspects of the application—such as actions for state modifications, components for UI elements, and reducers for handling state changes—the code becomes more modular and easier to manage. This approach fosters improved collaboration among developers, enhances code readability, and streamlines debugging and maintenance processes. The folder structure ensures a clear separation of concerns, making it straightforward to locate and modify specific parts of the codebase without affecting the entire application. Ultimately, this organizational strategy contributes to building a scalable and maintainable React Redux application. 

The src folder contains 'actions', 'components', and 'reducers' folders, each housing the actual logic and code for better understanding.
