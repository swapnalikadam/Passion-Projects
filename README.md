# React Redux E-commerce Shopping Cart
React Redux is used to create an e-commerce shopping cart website to structure the code with distinct folders for actions, components, and reducers to enhance code organization and maintainability. By logically
segregating different aspects of the application, such as actions for state modifications, components for UI elements, and reducers for handling state changes, the code becomes more modular and easier to manage.
This approach facilitates better collaboration among developers, improves code readability, and streamlines debugging and maintenance processes. The folder structure ensures a clear separation of concerns, making
it straightforward to locate and modify specific parts of the codebase without affecting the entire application. Ultimately, this organizational strategy contributes to building a scalable and maintainable React 
Redux application.
