# Passion-Projects
This repository features a variety of personal web development projects, ranging from responsive websites using fundamental HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript to developing a React Redux shopping cart for the checkout process on an e-commerce product-selling website. 

This repository is meticulously structured, with branches dedicated to different projects, aligning with my goal of designating each branch as a distinct project. This method leads to a reduced number of repositories, each specifically crafted for a unique purpose or intention. Furthermore, each branch has its own README file, providing detailed information about the corresponding project.
