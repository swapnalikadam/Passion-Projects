I have designed a web page using HTML and JavaScript for Tabular API Data Display, which fetches data from a product details REST API and presents it in a tabular form to users. I utilized the fetch method to retrieve data from the REST API. Additionally, I employed the map method to iterate over all the records in the API response.
